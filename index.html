         <h2>Barcelona, Spain</h2>
         <p> I spent the most time here and even started to pick up some of the language.  I had an opportunity to visit Villa Del Gottico and Gaudi's museum.
            I also really enjoyed the tapas and Crema Catalan. The latter of which was suspiciously similar to Creme Brulee.  Should you choose to share that obervance in Barcelona, be fully prepared to be met with disdain.
